This repo contains a couple of working samples I worked on from Dataquest's data analysis path.

* `Analyzing_Digital_Music_Shop_with_SQL.ipynb` -- Breakdown of sales by countries and markets to penetrate.
* `Exploring_Gun_Deaths_in_the_US.ipynb` -- Explores deaths caused by guns and analyzes possible trends.
* `NY_High_School_Analysis.ipynb` -- Analyzes high school graduates' college entrance exam performances.
